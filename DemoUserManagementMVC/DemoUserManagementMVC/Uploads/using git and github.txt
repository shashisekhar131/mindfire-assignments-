git is distributed version control system.

It is used to track changes in any set of files.
 

difference b/w git and github 

git is application that tracks the changes. 
github is place where we upload the files. 

USING GIT BASH 

step1:
go to folder right click and open git bash 
belagallus@BELAGALLUS-WIN10 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/git

step2:
to check whether current folder is a git repository or not
git status 

step3:
to create empty repository 
git init

step4:
now create a text file and check status
you will see that the created file is untracked 

now to track the changes add that file to git 
$ git add someText.txt

step5:
now do some changes in the file and check status 
you will see that changes are untracked 

   step1: now to add the changes
   $ git add someText.txt
   step2: commit the changes
   $git commit -m "first commit"

step6:
if there are 10 people working how to know who changed which feature
$git log 

commit f80129c1381b45690a812b42398f15d94e7ef3f4 (HEAD -> master)
Author: shashi <shashi184131@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 15 13:00:04 2024 +0530

setting the owner of all tracking changes
all changes will be saved to the repository linked to the given email
all global files and changes are linked to that email
$ git config --global email.name "shashi184131@gmail.com"


    first commit

if any changes again go step5

made changes in file 
$git add someText.txt 
$git commit -m "second commit"

to go to previous file  which has first commit
$git log --oneline
gives the id of all committed files
ed01eb3 (HEAD -> master) second commit
f80129c first commit

$git checkout f80129c 

now if you open your file you get your first code 

now if you want second version 

$git checkout ed01eb3


to clear the git bash 
clear 
now check the status 
$ git status 
no files to commit

delete someText.txt file and add git1.txt, git2.txt files 
now how to save this to git bash 

check status 
git status
HEAD detached at ed01eb3
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   git 1.txt
        new file:   git 2.txt
        deleted:    someText.txt


stage the changes 
You need to specify the files you want to stage. If you want to stage all changes, you can use a period (.) to represent all files:

git add .


git status 

[detached HEAD 5cd69a3] third commit
 3 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 git 1.txt
 create mode 100644 git 2.txt
 delete mode 100644 someText.txt

git commit -m
